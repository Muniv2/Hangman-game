# Hangman-game
The Hangman game prompts the user for a valid username and randomly selects a country name. Players guess letters, with blanks showing unguessed letters, while correct and incorrect guesses are tracked. The game provides feedback on remaining chances and ends when the player either guesses the word or uses up all 6 attempts.
